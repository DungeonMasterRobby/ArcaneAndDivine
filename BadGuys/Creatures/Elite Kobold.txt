TACTICS

During Combat Elite warriors are better equipped and trained than their ordinary counterparts. Even when outnumbered,
they hold their ground, shooting at foes with poisoned arrows and falling back to cover if attacked. They use 
stealth to sneak behind or outflank foes, and only engage in melee if they have no other choice.

Morale If reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, they order any remaining kobolds to hold the line while they retreat 
to safety to drink healing potions. They fight to the death only if cornered, or if they know their boss is watching.
