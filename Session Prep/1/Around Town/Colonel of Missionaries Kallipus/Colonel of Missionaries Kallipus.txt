TACTICS

During Combat Seelah is fearless, especially in the face of evil, and she faces fiends, undead, and those with malicious intent head-on.
Against particularly powerful evil foes—especially fiends and evil dragons—she channels her goddess's power into her attacks with her smite evil ability.
If she has already expended her daily uses of smite evil, she uses her divine bond to increase her weapon's power. When her allies are injured or in trouble,
Seelah puts herself in harm's way in an effort to heal them.
